/**
 * Class capable of detecting sequential read patterns.
 *
 * <p>The SequentialPatternDetector depends on the BlockStore which it is capable of 'inspecting'.
 * For now, pattern detection is very simple: if the previous byte is already stored by a block,
 * then we conclude that the byte is requested by a sequential read. In the future we should
 * probably extend this to work with some kind of tolerance or radius (i.e., look back more than a
 * single byte).
 *
 * <p>The other responsibility of this class is to compute what the 'generation' of a position is in
 * the BlockStore.
